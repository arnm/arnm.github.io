title: "Telegram vs WhatsApp: A Comprehensive Messenger Comparison"

I have been using both the [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and [WhatsApp](http://www.whatsapp.com/) messengers for about a year now and with my
WhatsApp trial service coming to an end in about a week I decided to compare both apps. We will focus on comparing the availability, messaging capabilities, and configuration options for both apps respectively.

## Availability

Before getting into the specific features of each app we must first know if it's even supported on our platforms of choice and if the people we want to communicate with are able to also use the app.

|                   | Telegram | WhatsApp |
| :-:               | :-:      | :-:      |
| Android           | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| iPhone            | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Windows Phone     | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| BlackBerry        | &#x2717; | &#x2713; |
| Nokia S40         | &#x2717; | &#x2713; |
| Symbian           | &#x2717; | &#x2713; |
| iTouch/iPad       | &#x2713; | &#x2717; |
| Web               | &#x2713; | &#x2717; |
| Windows/Mac/Linux | &#x2713; | &#x2717; |

From this table we can see that each app supports 6 platforms. Telegram not only focuses on mobile but also other platforms like the web and desktops while WhatsApp focuses only on mobile.

In addition to platform support we also want to compare the pricing and number of users of each service.

|                      | Telegram   | WhatsApp    |
| :-:                  | :-:        | :-:         |
| Users (Android Only) | 10 million | 500 million |
| Pricing              | Free       | $1.00 USD   |
| Subscription         | &#x2717;   | &#x2713;    |
| Ads                  | &#x2717;   | &#x2717;    |

Telegram is a completely free service while WhatsApp is based on a yearly subscription program. WhatsApp does have other payment options which allow users to pay a discounted price for a 3 or 5 year service expansion. Even though Telegram is completely free and provides a competitive service it does not have nearly as many users as WhatsApp. The large difference in active users may be due to the following:

- Telegram is relatively new app (released in August 2013)
    + WhatsApp was released in 2009
- Telegram does not have the backing of a huge company
    + WhatsApp is owned by Facebook

## Messaging

The first thing one would expect from a messaging app is the ability to send
unlimited messages to individuals and groups in a quick and easy manner. Here is a list of the categories used for this feature comparison:

- **Create a chat**: Send messages to another user.
- **Create a secret chat**: Send end-to-end encrypted messages, that do not get stored on servers, to another user and be able to set a self-destruct timer on each individual message for extra privacy.
- **Create a group chat**: Join or create a group chat to communicate with several users at a time.
- **Create a broadcast list**: Start separate chats with several users at once with a broadcast message.

|                | Telegram | WhatsApp |
| :-:            | :-:      | :-:      |
| Chat           | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Secret Chat    | &#x2713; | &#x2717; |
| Group Chat     | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Broadcast List | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |

While WhatsApp does not support "secret messages" their [messages are never stored on servers](http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/general/21197296) like [Telegrams "non secret messages" are](https://www.telegram.org/faq#q-why-not-just-make-all-chats-secret). There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. Not storing messages on servers provides a slightly higher feeling of security because no one will be able to hack into the servers, decrypt, and then read all of your stored messages. However, not storing the messages also does not allow for messages to be synced across your other devices like Telegram does.

Types of messages which can be sent:

|          | Telegram | WhatsApp |
| :-:      | :-:      | :-:      |
| Photo    | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Video    | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Audio    | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Location | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Contact  | &#x2717; | &#x2713; |
| Document | &#x2713; | &#x2717; |

The only differences here are that Telegram supports sending documents (doc, zip, mp3, etc) while WhatsApp cannot. WhatsApp allows you to share your contacts with others while Telegram cannot.

## Configuration and User Experience

Both apps are very similar in appearance and configuration options.

Both apps provide a smooth user experience with a clean user interface. 
Immediately after downloading and installing the apps for the first time you will need to create and account. The account creation process consists of two steps:

1. providing a phone number so you can be uniquely identified
2. providing a name to display to other users

Both apps offer many options for customizing your experience. Here is a list of some of the options provided in the settings for both apps:

- Set profile picture
- Set display name
- Customize notifications and sounds
- Block users
- Change chat background
- Toggle automatic download of photos and audio
- Delete conversations
- Deactivate accounts (removes everything)

Telegram provides these extra options:

- Enable/Disable animations
- Change application language (8 available languages)
- Terminate all session on all devices

WhatsApp provides these extra options:

- Change number
- Change your status
- Email conversations
- Clear conversations
- Backup conversations (they are not stored in cloud)

We can see a couple of big differences between both apps here:

- WhatsApp allows users to change phone numbers on their accounts
    + Telegram requires you to deactivate your old account and [create a new one for the new number ](https://telegram.org/faq#q-what-happens-if-i-change-my-phone-number)
- WhatsApp allows you to email conversations while Telegram does not

I can only assume that Telegram does not have these features because they want to ensure, as much as possible, the account is in the rightful hands of the owner and that their privacy is being respected.

## Conclusion

Like I stated before, my free trial with WhatsApp is coming to an end. Will I renew my WhatsApp account or will I stick with Telegram? Both products provide an easy to use interface to communicate with others and both are made widely available with their multi-platform support.

I have decided to go with go with Telegram because of their open [API](https://core.telegram.org/api) and [protocol](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto) and because they provide just as good of a service as WhatsApp for no cost what so ever. I am a software engineer who appreciates open software. The fact that they have made these resources available to others allows for quick maturity of the project and the possibility of the addition of even more devices in the future. 

I constantly switch devices and operating systems and this [Telegram Chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/telegram-unofficial/clhhggbfdinjmjhajaheehoeibfljjno) has been invaluable to me in the days where I have to work on several computers.

Unfortunately, most people do not see the tremendous upside Telegram has as a service. Any casual user will simply look at how many reviews or how many downloads an application has and base their decision on that. Although this is a legitimate way to make a decision, no one wants to use and app nobody else is using, I feel like it is not the mentality necessary to push innovation. Granted, an everyday user is not worried about that sort of thing, they mainly just care about what the current hot, easy to use app is.
